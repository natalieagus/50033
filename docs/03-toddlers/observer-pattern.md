# The Observer Pattern

[The Observer Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) is a software design pattern that allows you to create modular game logic that is executed when an event in the game is triggered. It typically works by allowing **observers**, in this case, other **scripts**, to subscribe one or more of their own functions to a subject’s event.

## Refactor PlayerMovement

We are now ready to utilise the new input system to control Mario's movement. Let's refactor a few methods in `PlayerMovement.cs`. Firstly, take out the code at `Update()` that flips Mario's sprite to face left or right into a new method that takes in an integer. If that integer is `-1`, it means that Mario should face left and we flip the sprite if he's initially facing right, and vice versa. Then, we also refactor `FixedUpdate()` to separate the the logic of moving Mario and making Mario Jump.

    void Update()

            jumpedState = false;

        }
    }


```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::important
Notice how `MoveCheck`, `Jump` and `JumpHold` are declared as `public`? That's on purpose. This is because we want to register them with `UnityEvent` later on.
:::

The idea is as follows:

1. When `move` action is performed, we want to call `Move(value)` where `value` is 1 or -1 depending on whether Mario is moving to the right of to the left.
2. When `move` action is canceled, we want to call `Move(0)`

We could do this by **referencing** Mario's PlayerMovement script and call the methods manually, **or** by using **Events**. In particular, we are going to implement the **observer pattern** using **UnityEvent**.

When the event is triggered by the owner or whoever `Invoke()` it, the observers’ functions are called in response. So for instance, when `move` action is cancelled, it will invoke a `moveCheck` Event. Any methods subcribed to `moveCheck` will be called in sequence.

### UnityEvent

Unity events are a way to hook up function calls between GameObjects in the editor and **serialize** those calls. They are designed to be populated by the developer at design-time. Create a new script (if you haven't already) called `ActionManager.cs` and attach it to Mario:

```cs title="ActionManager.cs"

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class ActionManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent jump;
    public UnityEvent jumpHold;
    public UnityEvent<int> moveCheck;

    public void OnJumpHoldAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        if (context.started)
            Debug.Log("JumpHold was started");
        else if (context.performed)
        {
            Debug.Log("JumpHold was performed");
            Debug.Log(context.duration);
            jumpHold.Invoke();
        }
        else if (context.canceled)
            Debug.Log("JumpHold was cancelled");
    }

    // called twice, when pressed and unpressed
    public void OnJumpAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        if (context.started)
            Debug.Log("Jump was started");
        else if (context.performed)
        {
            jump.Invoke();
            Debug.Log("Jump was performed");
        }
        else if (context.canceled)
            Debug.Log("Jump was cancelled");

    }

    // called twice, when pressed and unpressed
    public void OnMoveAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        // Debug.Log("OnMoveAction callback invoked");
        if (context.started)
        {
            Debug.Log("move started");
            int faceRight = context.ReadValue<float>() > 0 ? 1 : -1;
            moveCheck.Invoke(faceRight);
        }
        if (context.canceled)
        {
            Debug.Log("move stopped");
            moveCheck.Invoke(0);
        }

    }
}

```

We assume you used **Invoke Unity Events** behavior in `Player Input` component as shown:

<ImageCard path={require("./images/management/2023-08-11-16-08-44.png").default} widthPercentage="100%"/>

Then, **serialize** the three events: Jump, JumpHold, and MoveCheck at the inspector to call the relevant functions in `PlayerMovement.cs` script:

<ImageCard path={require("./images/management/2023-08-11-16-09-48.png").default} widthPercentage="100%"/>

### Unity EventSystem Argument Binding Modes

Don't forget to use **Dynamic** parameter:

<ImageCard path={require("./images/management/2023-08-11-16-10-15.png").default} widthPercentage="100%"/>

Formally, Unity refers to this behavior as _Dynamic_ vs _Persistent_ (**Static**) parameter binding in the Inspector UnityEvent drawer.

| Term                           | Unity’s internal concept                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic**                    | **Dynamic Listener**                           | The listener method’s parameter <span class="orange-bold">matches</span> the event’s generic type (e.g. `UnityEvent<float>` calls `void OnChange(float value)`). The event system automatically <span class="orange-bold">injects the runtime argument</span> when the event fires. We use this when ou method should respond to the event’s runtime value (e.g., slider value, score update). |
| **Static** (or **Persistent**) | **Persistent Listener with Constant Argument** | The method doesn’t consume the event’s argument (or you choose to override it). The Inspector exposes an input field so you can supply a <span class="orange-bold">constant</span>, serialized value. We use this if we always want the same fixed parameter (e.g., always set score to 0 when reset button clicked).                                                                          |

You’ll see both whenever:

- The `UnityEvent` is **generic** (e.g. `UnityEvent<int>`, `UnityEvent<float>`, etc.), _and_
- The target method has a **matching parameter type**

If the event is non-generic (plain `UnityEvent` with no parameters), then only the static binding makes sense. We won’t see a “Dynamic” section because there’s no argument to pass.

:::info Not the C# Static Keyword
The "static" keyword here has absolutely _nothing_ to do with the C# static keyword. “Static” just means “use a fixed constant value, not the dynamic event argument.” It does not mean the method itself is a static class method, nor does it relate to C#’s static concept of memory/shared class scope.
:::

### Callbacks Must be Public

If we did not set `MoveCheck` to be **public**, then we would not be able to select that function from the inspector. What we did above is declare three events that will be **invoked** whenever there's **interaction**. for instance, we call `jump.Invoke()` under `OnJumpAction` callback, but only when `context.performed` is `true`. This will in turn call the method `Jump()` defined in `PlayerMovement.cs`.

The method `MoveCheck(int value)` takes in one `int` parameter, and so we need to use UnityEvent with **generic** type, and declare it as `public UnityEvent<int> moveCheck`.

:::playtest
Save and test that Mario can still move, skid, etc, jump, along with higher jump when you hold the spacebar.
:::

<DeepDive title="Deep Dive: UnityEvent vs UnityAction">
    
Some of you might have heard about `UnityAction`. They're similar to UnityEvent. Here's an example that will lead into identical results:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="1" label="UnityEvent">

```cs
class Game {
  public static UnityEvent OnLogin = new UnityEvent();
}

class LoginForm {
  Awake() {
    Login();
  }

  private void Login() {
     Game.OnLogin.Invoke();
  }
}

class Player {
  Awake() {
     Game.OnLogin.AddListener(OnLoggedIn);
  }

  private void OnLoggedIn() {
    isLogged = true;
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="UnityAction">

```cs
class Game {
  public static UnityAction OnLogin = new delegate {};
}

class LoginForm {
  Awake() {
    Login();
  }

  private void Login() {
     Game.OnLogin();
  }
}

class Player {
  Awake() {
     Game.OnLogin += OnLoggedIn;
  }

  private void OnLoggedIn() {
    isLogged = true;
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The difference between the two is that `UnityEvent` show up on inspector and you can serialize `OnLogin` there, whereas `UnityAction` must be used solely from script. It comes down to _style_ choice.
</DeepDive>

### Detect Mouse Click

Although mouse click is not necessary in Super Mario Bros, let's try to capture the position of a mouse click on the Game screen for the sake of other games that you might create. Firstly, let's rename our control scheme into MarioActions because we no longer _just_ use the keyboard (it's good to give naming that makes sense). Then, edit the control scheme and add the **Mouse** device.

:::warning
If you don't add Mouse into the control scheme, you will not be able to detect mouse clicks!
:::

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/add-mousescheme.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>

Then as shown in the video above, add an action called `click` that detects Left Button Mouse press. This alone however is insufficient to capture the "location" of the mouse. We want it to **also** report the location of the mouse click, and for this we need to create a **Binding with One Modifier**. A **modifier** is a condition that has to be held for **binding** to come through. Here we set the action to pass a **value** of control type **Vector2**, the Modifier as the Left Button mouse click, and the Binding as Mouse position.

> Please read the documentation about [bindings and modifiers here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.6/manual/ActionBindings.html#one-modifier).

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/binding-one-modifier.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>

Now we can define **two more** callbacks in `ActionManager.cs`:

```cs


    public void OnClickAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        if (context.started)
            Debug.Log("mouse click started");
        else if (context.performed)
        {
            Debug.Log("mouse click performed");
        }
        else if (context.canceled)
            Debug.Log("mouse click cancelled");
    }

    public void OnPointAction(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        if (context.performed)
        {
            Vector2 point = context.ReadValue<Vector2>();
            Debug.Log($"Point detected: {point}");

        }
    }

```

:::playtest
Set the callbacks inside Player Input component, and test the mouse clicks in the console:

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/clickmouse.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>
:::

### Why `ActionManager.cs`?

Can we implement the input system callbacks directly at `PlayerMovement.cs`? Yes, sure we can. It comes down to preference and principle: do you prefer separating the scripts between managing your actions state (deciding what to do depending on the `context` state) and **implementing** the game logic (deciding **how** to jump)? There's no right answer to any of this.

### Be Careful when Changing Method Name

If you happen to refactor your code and **change** the method name, e.g: `onJumpHoldAction` into `OnJumpHoldAction`, whatever you have set on the inspector <span className="orange-bold">will not</span> change with it. It will be written as **missing**:

<ImageCard path={require("./images/management/2023-08-11-17-45-00.png").default} widthPercentage="50%"/>

You have to fix it too in the inspector. This is very tedious, but so is creating everything via script. It's a give and take.

## Delegates

We used `UnityEvent` above as some kind of **function container** that we can `Invoke()` and then it will call all functions subcribed to it _in order_. We don't really see it in the example above because we only have **one** function subscribed to it as defined in the Inspector. Let's dive deeper into how it works.

:::info Delegate
A delegate is a reference pointer to a method. It allows us to treat method as a variable and pass method as a variable for a callback. When a delegate gets called, it notifies all methods that reference the delegate.

The basic idea behind them is exactly the same as a subscription magazine. Anyone can subscribe to the service and they will receive the update at the right time automatically.
:::

You can declare a delegate with the delegate keyword and specifies its signature (return type and parameters):

```cs
public delegate returnType MethodName (paramType1 paramName1, paramType2 paramName2, ...);
```

For example, something like this:

```cs
public delegate void SimpleGameEvent();
```

:::note
You can declare a delegate <span className="orange-bold">without</span> placing it within a class in C#. Delegates are a type that can be declared at the <span className="orange-bold">namespace</span> level, which means they can exist **outside** of any class or structure. This makes it accessible to any class or code within the namespace.
:::

### C# Event

To allow other scripts to subscribe to this delegate, we need to create an <span className="orange-bold">instance</span> of that delegate, using the `event` keyword:

```cs
public static event SimpleGameEvent IncreaseScore;
```

We can also use the delegate directly using its name without the `event` keyword:

```cs
public static SimpleGameEvent IncreaseScore;
```

:::info event keyword
Without the `event` keyword, `IncreaseScore` can be cast by anyone (unless it is not public, but that will mean that not every other script can subscribe to it). If we want <span className="orange-bold">only</span> the **owner** of the **delegate** to cast, then the event keyword is used.
:::

Since the event is declared as `static`, that means other scripts can subscribe to it via the Classname. Whether you should make an event static or not <span className="orange-bold">depends</span> on your design and how you intend to use it.

- If you want a single event that is shared across all instances _or_ if you need to raise the event <span className="orange-bold">without having an instance of the class</span>, make it `static`.
- If you want each instance to have its own event handling, make it non-static.

<DeepDive title="DeepDive: C# Events">

You can try and experiment with C# events with the following 3 scripts:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="1" label="SomeEventManager.cs">

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

// declare delegate at namespace level
public delegate void SomeGameEvent(int score);

public class SomeEventManager
{
    // with event keyword, can only be invoked within this class
    public static event SomeGameEvent SampleEventFoo;

    // without event keyword, can be invoked by anyone else
    public static SomeGameEvent SampleEventBar;

    public static void LaunchEventFooBy(int points)
    {
        // Raise the static event
        SampleEventFoo?.Invoke(points);
    }


}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="SomeEventManagerNonStatic">

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class SomeEventManagerNonStatic : MonoBehaviour
{
    // static event
    public static event SomeGameEvent SampleEventBaz;

    // non static event
    public event SomeGameEvent SampleEventQux;

    // these methods needs an instance of PlaygroundEventManager
    public void LaunchSampleEventBaz(int points)
    {
        // Raise the static event
        SampleEventBaz?.Invoke(points);
    }

    public void LaunchSampleEventQux(int points)
    {
        // Raise the instance event
        SampleEventQux?.Invoke(points);
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3" label="TestEventInPlayground.cs">

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class TestEventInPlayground : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        // subscribe without having the instance of the class
        SomeEventManager.SampleEventFoo += TestEventFoo;
        SomeEventManager.SampleEventBar += TestEventBar;
        SomeEventManagerNonStatic.SampleEventBaz += TestEventBaz;

        // subscribe by finding instance of the class
        FindObjectOfType<SomeEventManagerNonStatic>().SampleEventQux += TestEventQux;
    }

    public void TestEventFoo(int score)
    {
        Debug.Log($"TestEventFoo is called with parameter value {score}");
    }
    public void TestEventBar(int score)
    {
        Debug.Log($"TestEventBar is called with parameter value {score}");
    }
    public void TestEventBaz(int score)
    {
        Debug.Log($"TestEventBaz is called with parameter value {score}");
    }
    public void TestEventQux(int score)
    {
        Debug.Log($"TestEventQux is called with parameter value {score}");
    }

    public void Press()
    {
        // invoke via PlaygroundEventManager static method
        SomeEventManager.LaunchEventFooBy(1);
        // invoke event directly
        SomeEventManager.SampleEventBar.Invoke(2);

        // invoke from instance
        FindObjectOfType<SomeEventManagerNonStatic>().LaunchSampleEventBaz(3);
        FindObjectOfType<SomeEventManagerNonStatic>().LaunchSampleEventQux(4);
    }
}


```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now attach `SomeEventManagerNonStatic` and `TestEventInPlayground` to some test GameObject, and then create a button to call `Press()`: you will find four Debug messages printed out at the Console:

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/test-event-cs.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>
Here are a few important observations:

- `SampleEventFoo` and `SampleEventBar` are invoked **without** the need to make an instance of `SomeEventManager` class.
- `SampleEventBaz`, despite being declared as `static`, could **not** be invoked **without** an instance of `SomeEventManagerStatic` because of the `event` keyword when declaring it.
- We can Invoke static event `SampleEventBaz` in non-static method
- `SampleEventQux` will <span className="orange-bold">not</span> exist without an instance of `SomeEventManagerNonStatic` class.

:::important
In the code above, the `SomeGameEvent` delegate is declared at the [namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces) level, making it <span className="orange-bold">accessible</span> to any class or code within that namespace. This allows you to use the `SomeGameEvent` delegate in various classes or parts of your application without the need to encapsulate it within a specific class.

In the example above we simply utilise `SomeGameEvent` in another class: `SomeEventManagerNonStatic`.
:::

</DeepDive>

### UnityEvent

We will **mainly** utilise `UnityEvent` instead of C# Event and delegates because the former allows us to conveniently set it up via the inspector and that it covers basic signatures that we need (return type of `void` and accept generic parameters, up to four).

### Increase Game Score with Coin

When Mario touches a box or brick with Coin, we are supposed to increase the game score. Right now the `score` state is stored in `JumpOverGoomba`. `PlayerMovement` **has** to reference this script in order to change its `score` during restart:

```cs title="PlayerMovement.cs"

    public void ResetGame()
    {
        // ... other instructions

        // reset Goomba
        foreach (Transform eachChild in enemies.transform)
        {
            eachChild.localPosition = eachChild.GetComponent<EnemyMovement>().startPosition;
        }

        //highlight-start
        // reset score
        jumpOverGoomba.score = 0;
//highlight-end

        // reset animation
        marioAnimator.SetTrigger("gameRestart");
        alive = true;

        // reset camera position
        gameCamera.position = new Vector3(0, 0, -10);
    }

```

`ScoreText` is also modified by three scripts separately: `GameManager`, `JumpOverGoomba`, and `PlayerMovement`. Here's a graph that illustrates referencing between scripts/GameObjects:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ST(ScoreText)
    PM(PlayerMovement)
    JG(JumpOverGoomba)
    GM(GameManager)
    GO(GameOverPanel)
    RB(RestartButton)
    PM-->|resets|ST
    JG-->|updates|ST
    GM-->|sets transform|ST
    GM-->|sets transform|RB
    GM-->|toggles|GO
    PM-->|resets score|JG
    PM-->|sets GameOver|GM
    GM-->|restarts|PM
    RB-->|restarts|GM
```

It's pretty messy right now:

- ScoreText is referenced by **three** different scripts
- PlayerMovement and GameManager controls each other
- GameManager does not "manage" the game: score is stored inside JumpOverGoomba

Let's fix it to something neater as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    JG(JumpOverGoomba)
    PM(PlayerMovement)
    ST(ScoreText)
    GM(GameManager<br>score)
    GO(GameOverPanel)
    RB(RestartButton)
    GOOM(Goomba)
    JG-->|increases|GM
    GM-->|restarts|PM
    GM-->|restarts|ST
    GM-->|restarts|GOOM
    GM-->|updates|ST
    PM-->|sets GameOver|GM
    GM-->|sets GameOver|ST
    GM-->|sets GameOver|RB
    GM-->|toggles<br>GameOver, GameRestart|GO
    RB-->|restarts|GM
```

### Major Refactoring using Events

We need to create **four** different **events**: `GameOver`, `GameStart`, `GameRestart`, and `ScoreChange` in `GameManager.cs` and let other scripts subscribe to it and update themselves accordingly. Create **two** new scripts: `HUDManager.cs` and `EnemyManager.cs` which will contain callbacks to subscribe to the events above:

:::caution important
There are many things to do, but the big idea is that we need to:

1. **Remove** storing score at `JumpOverGoomba.cs`
2. Remove **script** references in inspector except to `GameManager.cs` (see video below)

:::

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/setup-events.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>

:::playtest
Your actual implementation may vary a little, such as the game restart and gameover scene that is part of Checkoff 1.
:::

### Animation Event Tool

Now that we have refactored everything to utilise Events as much as possible and removing direct references to scripts, we can register a **callback** via AnimationEvent when a coin spawn is triggered. Specifically, we want to call the `IncreaseScore(1)` method inside GameManager instance.

:::caution
Recall that AnimationEvent will only list out public methods with signature: return type `void` and zero argument only from scripts attached to that GameObject where the Animator component is? That means it will <span className="orange-bold">not</span> detect IncreaseScore method since that method is within GameManager and not Coin.
:::

To help us, we shall create a **helper** script. We name it `AnimationEventIntTool.cs`:

```cs title="AnimationEventIntTool.cs"
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class AnimationEventIntTool : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int parameter;
    public UnityEvent<int> useInt;
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

    }

    public void TriggerIntEvent()
    {

        useInt.Invoke(parameter); // safe to invoke even without callbacks

    }
}
```

Usage steps:

1. Attach the `AnimationEventIntTool.cs` to **all** coins.
   <ImageCard path={require("./images/observer-pattern/2023-08-16-09-26-20.png").default} widthPercentage="70%"/>
2. Then for all coins, modify its animation clip to trigger events at the end of it.
   <ImageCard path={require("./images/observer-pattern/2023-08-16-09-26-42.png").default} widthPercentage="70%"/>
3. Link up GameManager **instance** of this Scene to get the `IncreaseScore(int score)` callback at the inspector

In our demo below, we have two events (but you might just have this one, it's fine). Make sure you set it to call all your events from all scripts attached to the Coin.

<VideoItem path={"https://50033.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/week-3/setup-callback-coin.mp4"} widthPercentage="100%"/>

:::danger Setting Prefab value with Instance
In the beginning, we set GameManager's IncreaseScore into all Coin script, but we seem to have to do it again at 1:09. This is because we **apply** the changes to ALL question-box-coin prefab at 00:42.

GameManager IncreaseScore is a Scene **instance**, meaning that it does _not persist_. A prefab cannot refer to a script instance from another GameObjects that is <span className="orange-bold">NOT</span> part of the prefab, because it wouldn't know if that instance will exist in the scene that it's currently spawned at (yes, we can instantiate prefabs at any scene at runtime). That's why the blue line indicator besides all the prefab in the Hierarchy does not disappear even after we apply the changes to all prefabs:

<ImageCard path={require("./images/observer-pattern/2023-08-16-09-31-02.png").default} widthPercentage="50%"/>

We also need to manually set ALL coins to call IncreaseScore from this scene's GameManager instance, as you see in the beginning of the video or at 1:09.
:::

## Summary

We have seen how convenient it is to set callbacks via the inspector. However, if our callbacks come from another GameObject instance that's not part of the prefab's, then we would have to do that each time we instantiate a prefab.

Setting things up from the inspector (as opposed to from the script) can be a double-edged sword. On one hand: it is convenient and visually affirming, while on the other hand: it is easy to miss a few things or "forgot" to set it up.
